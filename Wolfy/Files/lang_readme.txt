If you want to create your own language file, please take a template from the link below:
https://github.com/NaolShow/Wolfy/tree/master/Wolfy/Localization

The language files generated directly by the application 
(in the "Langs" folder are in disorder and without comments. 
Which is complicated to modify the files.

Thank you - NaolShow
