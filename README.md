### TheseScripts is available in several languages*:
- English
- French
- German
- Spanish
- Italian
- Russian
- Custom Languages
          
* Languages: "French" and "English" have (normally) perfect translations. (I'm French and I'm not too bad in English ^^).
But for the other languages, they were made from an online translator. Named DeepL.

For people who want to help me correct incorrect translations, please contact on my youtube channel, or in "issues" tab.
